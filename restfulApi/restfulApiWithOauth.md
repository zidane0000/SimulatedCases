# RESTful API with OAuth Integration

Before proceeding, please ensure you have read the original `restfulApi.md` document to understand the basic setup and execution of a RESTful API using Go.

## Introduction to OAuth

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. It is widely used for token-based authentication and authorization.

### Key Concepts of OAuth

1. **Client**: The application requesting access to a resource on behalf of the user.
2. **Resource Owner**: The user who authorizes an application to access their account.
3. **Authorization Server**: The server that authenticates the resource owner and issues access tokens.
4. **Resource Server**: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

### OAuth Flow

1. **Authorization Request**: The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
2. **Authorization Grant**: The resource owner provides authorization to the client.
3. **Access Token Request**: The client requests an access token from the authorization server.
4. **Access Token Response**: The authorization server issues an access token to the client.
5. **Access Resource**: The client uses the access token to request the protected resource from the resource server.

### Implementing OAuth in a RESTful API

To integrate OAuth into your RESTful API, you will need to:

1. **Register Your Application**: Obtain client credentials from the OAuth provider.
2. **Implement Authorization Code Flow**: Handle the redirection and token exchange process.
3. **Secure Endpoints**: Protect your API endpoints by validating access tokens.

### Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Validate Tokens**: Ensure that access tokens are valid and not expired.
- **Scope Management**: Define and enforce scopes to limit access to resources.
